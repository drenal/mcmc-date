The alignment =step1-strassert-136taxa.phy= in this folder
- can be downloaded from the website of [[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-22044-z#Sec15][nature communications]] (Supplementary
  Data 2); and
- is available under the [[https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/][Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)]] license.
I have changed the taxon names to be shorter and easier to handle, and I have
converted the file from FASTA to Phylip format.

The tree =step1-strassert-136taxa.unrooted.tre= is the unrooted version of the
tree in Figure 3.

The tree =step3-strassert-136taxa-calibrations.rooted.tre= contains all
calibrations listed in Table 1.
