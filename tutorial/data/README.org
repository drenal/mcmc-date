The alignment =strassert-136taxa.phy= in this folder
- was published by [cite/text:@Strassert2021];
- can be downloaded from the website of [[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-22044-z#Sec15][nature communications]] (Supplementary
  Data 2); and

I have changed the taxon names to be shorter and easier to handle, and I have
converted the file from FASTA to Phylip format.

The tree =strassert-136taxa.unrooted.tre= is the unrooted version of
the tree in Figure 3.

The tree =strassert-136taxa-calibrations.rooted.tre= contains all calibrations
listed in Table 1.
