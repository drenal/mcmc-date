The program [McmcDate](https://github.com/dschrempf/mcmc-date) can date a phylogenetic tree with constraints. That is, it
can estimate the ages of the ancestral nodes of a phylogenetic tree with node
age calibrations, node order constraints, and node braces. McmcDate is fast
because it approximates the phylogenetic likelihood with a multivariate normal
distribution.

For a tutorial, please see the [McmcDate tutorial](tutorial/tutorial.md).
