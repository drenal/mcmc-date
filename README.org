Estimate node ages of a phylogeny by approximating the phylogenetic likelihood
with a multivariate normal distribution.

Modules containing definitions specific to the analysis:

- [[file:src/Definitions.hs][Definitions]] :: File names, state space, prior distribution, and the
  likelihood function of the MCMC sampler, as well as the proposals and the
  monitors.

- [[file:src/Calibrations.hs][Calibrations]] and [[file:src/Constraints.hs][Constraints]] :: Calibrations of node ages and node order
  constraints.

Other modules:

- [[file:src/Tools.hs][Tools]] :: Miscellaneous tools to prepare the data.

- [[file:src/Main.hs][Main]] :: Functions to prepare the data, run and continue the
  Metropolis-Hasting-Green algorithm.

If you try to understand what is going on, or if you want to change analysis
settings, your starting point should be 'Definitions'.
