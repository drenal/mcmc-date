* McmcDate

[[https://github.com/dschrempf/mcmc-date][McmcDate]] can date a phylogenetic tree with constraints. That is, it can estimate
the ages of the ancestral nodes of a phylogenetic tree with node age
calibrations, node order constraints, and node braces. McmcDate is fast because
it approximates the phylogenetic likelihood with a multivariate normal
distribution.

For documentation, please see the [[file:tutorial/tutorial.pdf][McmcDate tutorial]].
