Estimate node ages of a phylogeny by approximating the phylogenetic likelihood
with a multivariate normal distribution.

Modules containing definitions specific to the analysis:

- [[file:src/Definitions.hs][Definitions]] :: File names, state space, prior distribution, and the
  likelihood function of the MCMC sampler, as well as the proposals and the
  monitors.

See the [[file:test/run][test run]].

Other modules:

- [[file:src/Main.hs][Main]] :: Functions to prepare the data, run and continue the
  Metropolis-Hasting-Green algorithm.

- [[file:src/Options.hs][Options]] :: Handle command line options.

- [[file:src/Tools.hs][Tools]] :: Miscellaneous tools.

If you try to understand what is going on, or if you want to change analysis
settings, your starting point should be 'Definitions'.
