Estimate node ages of a phylogeny by approximating the phylogenetic likelihood
with a multivariate normal distribution.

Modules containing definitions specific to the analysis:

Modules:

- [[file:app/Definitions.hs][Definitions]] :: Proposals and monitors, configuration.

- [[file:app/Hamiltonian.hs][Hamiltonian]] :: Hamiltonian proposal.

- [[file:app/Main.hs][Main]] :: Functions to prepare the data, run and continue the
  Metropolis-Hasting-Green algorithm.

- [[file:app/Options.hs][Options]] :: Handle command line options.

- [[file:app/Probability.hs][Probability]] :: Prior and likelihood functions.

- [[file:app/State.hs][State]] :: State space. If you try to understand what is going on, or if you
  want to change analysis settings, your starting point should be =State=.

- [[file:app/Tools.hs][Tools]] :: Miscellaneous tools.
