\noindent The analyses are split into the following directories:

: ├── results
: ├── results-calibrations
: └── results-calibrations-constraints

\noindent Let =name= be the analysis name. In each directory, the files are
structured as follows:

- =name.params.00.monitor= :: Monitor file of all parameters; can be opened in
  Tracer. The first 5000 iterations are burn in. Each run includes a total
  number of approximately 20000 iterations. The index =00= means that this is
  the first chain of four parallel chains, the other three chains are heated,
  and may be ignored.
- =name.ratetree.00.monitor= :: Monitor file of the relative rate tree. Each
  branch stores the relative rate used on that branch.
- =name.timetree.00.monitor= :: Monitor file of the absolute or relative time
  tree. Each branch stores the absolute or relative time between speciations.

\noindent For the following files, the burn in of 5000 iteration has already
been excluded:
- =name.timetree.00.ages.full= :: Table of node ages. Each row shows the ages of
  a specific node for all iterations. The nodes are integer indexed, and leaf
  names are shown when available. The indices are distributed in pre-order. That
  is, for a tree, we index the root first, then the sub trees from left to right
  (sometime called depth first). For your reference, I have created a tree with
  all node indices =name.meantree.index=.
- =name.timetree.00.ages.summary= :: Table of node ages. Each row shows the mean
  age and the variance of the age of a specific node. Further, the minimum ages,
  the maximum ages, and the 95% confidence intervals are shown.
- =name.timetree.00.monitor.nex= :: Nexus file of the tree monitor; can be
  directly opened with /Densitree/.
- =name.timetree.00.tree.mean= :: Tree with node ages denoting the mean node age
  across all iterations.
- =name.timetree.00.tree.variance= :: Tree with node ages denoting the variance
  of node ages across all iterations.

\noindent Other interesting files:
- =name.meantree= :: Tree with branch lengths storing the average number of
  substitutions per site.
- =name.meantree.index= :: Same as =name.meantree= but the node indices are
  printed instead of the node names.
- =name.timetree.00.monitor.thinned= :: Thinned monitor file. Only every fifth
  iterations is printed. Used to create the Nexus file for /Densitree/.

\noindent Files related to the MCMC sampler:
- =name.data= :: Internal data used by the sampler (mean branch lengths measured
  in average number of substitutions per site, covariance matrix, and so on).
- =name.mcmc.log= :: Log file of the MCMC sampler. One can have a look at the
  proposals, the acceptance rates, and more.
- =name.mcmc.mc3= :: Saved state for continuing the MCMC sampler.
- =name.mcmc.setting= :: Saved settings such as the analysis name, the burn in
  configuration and much more.

\noindent The calibration name includes the boundaries, so they can be nicely
viewed in Tracer at the x-axis label. For example, when opening the file
=results-calibrations-constraints/name.params.00.monitor=, the age distribution
of a node calibrated by a calibration may look like this:
